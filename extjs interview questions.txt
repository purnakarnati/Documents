What is config property in extjs?
   (There is also a dedicated config property that gets processed by the powerful Ext.Class pre-processors before the class is created. Features include:

	Configurations are completely encapsulated from other class members
	Getter and setter methods for every config property are automatically generated into the class prototype during class creation if methods are not already defined.
	The auto-generated setter method calls the apply method (if defined on the class) internally before setting the value. You may override the apply method for a config property if you need to run custom logic before setting the value. If your apply method does not return a value, the setter will not set the value. The update method (if defined) will also be called when a different value is set. Both the apply and update methods are passed the new value and the old value as params.
	For Ext classes that use the configs, you don’t need to call initConfig() manually. However, for your own classes that extend Ext.Base, initConfig() still needs to be called.)
